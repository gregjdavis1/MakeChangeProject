### Make Change Project

#### Description
This is a program to calculate change for a purchase.
*The user is prompted to enter the price of an item.
*The user is then asked how much money was tendered by the customer.
*The program calculates the amount of change owed to the customer and then tells the cashier exactly what bills and coins should be returned to the customer.

#### Lessons Learned
This was my first "real" programming assignment in this class. I had fun. The most challenging part for me was the act of breaking inertia. I spent a TON of time just planning and trying to figure out the best way to start the code. I feel like I would have saved time if I just placed my fingers on the keyboard sooner and forced them to bang away. A good plan is often better than a perfect plan. Regardless, I am satisfied with the results and I look forward to learning more.
